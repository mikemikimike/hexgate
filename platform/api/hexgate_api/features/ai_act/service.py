"""Assemble, sign and store one AI Act evidence report.

Generation is synchronous: a 180-day window costs a handful of ClickHouse
aggregates plus one bounded sample per table. If that stops fitting in a
request it becomes a job; it is not one today.

Reads go through the existing feature services wherever one already answers
the question (``audit.summarize``, ``audit.list_decisions``,
``audit.list_ban_enforcements``, ``summarize_llm_invocations``). The two
queries written here answer questions none of those does: the conditional
distinct counts section 3 and section 4 need, and each table's coverage
metadata. Both build their WHERE through ``query_scope.scope_filters``, so
every read is project-scoped by the same code path as the dashboard's.
