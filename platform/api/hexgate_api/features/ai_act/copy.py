"""Every fixed string the evidence report emits, in one module.

The report must never state that a system, a project or an operator is
compliant, and must never classify a system — it states which controls were in
place and which events were recorded, and it attributes the risk tier to the
operator who asserted it. Keeping the prose here means a reviewer checks that
rule by reading one file rather than grepping an assembler.

Nothing here is per-report; the assembler supplies every varying value.

# Section 2, human oversight (Art. 14, 26(2)). One fixed template for every
# agent: v0 generates no prose. It describes mechanisms the platform actually
# operates, so the text has to stay in step with the two Ban kinds and the
# needs_approval outcome.
HUMAN_OVERSIGHT: Final = (
    "Human oversight of this agent rests on two mechanisms. First, approval "
    "gating: where a role's cell in the matrix above reads Approval, a call "
    "made under that role alone is not executed on the caller's authority — "
    "the SDK returns a needs-approval decision to the host application, which "
    "must route the call to a person before it runs. This is a per-role "
    "statement and not a guarantee about every caller: a caller carrying "
    "several roles is resolved to the most permissive of their cells, so "
    "another role reading Allow for the same tool removes the gate for that "
    "caller. Second, two operator kill switches: an "
    "agent ban stops every call by the named agent, and a user ban stops "
    "every call made on behalf of the named user. Both are evaluated at the "
    "SDK's invoke-time gate ahead of policy, take effect on the agent's next "
    "ban-feed refresh, and are recorded — creation, the operator who created "
    "them, and every blocked attempt (section 3)."
