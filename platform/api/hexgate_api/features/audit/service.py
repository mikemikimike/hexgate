    (keyword-only, see ``BatchItem``) — resolved per item, because a consumer
    batch aggregates across Kafka records and so can span projects and agents.

    Contract with the caller (the span-enricher job): payloads arrive already
    byte-capped and redacted — that job is the authoritative server-side
    enforcement point, so unlike ``insert_decision`` there is no cap check
    here.

    Retry-safe rather than atomic: ClickHouse commits per block (and the
    driver may re-send once on a dropped keep-alive), so a failed call can
    have landed part of the batch. The caller's move on any failure is to
    retry the whole batch. What makes that safe is the table engine, and the
    guarantee is *eventual*, not immediate: ReplacingMergeTree(received_at)
    keeps every inserted row on disk and only collapses rows sharing a sort
    key (project_id, occurred_at, event_id) — highest received_at wins — when
    a background merge happens to cover the parts holding them. Merges are
    opportunistic, with no upper bound on when they run, and the read paths
    (``summarize``, ``timeseries``, ``list_decisions``) query without
    ``FINAL``, so after a retry both copies of each event_id are counted
    until that merge lands — typically seconds to minutes on these tables,
    but not guaranteed. Only ``SELECT ... FINAL`` (or an argMax GROUP BY)
    sees the collapsed view before then. Two further edges: dedup never
    crosses the monthly received_at partition, so a retry that straddles a
    month boundary double-counts permanently (accepted — a seconds-wide
    window, at most once a month); and a duplicate event_id *within* one
    batch is not reliably collapsed at insert time. ``optimize_on_insert``
    applies the engine's merge to each inserted *block*, and the driver
    splits a large batch into ~2MB blocks — so two copies in the same block
    do collapse on the way in (observed: last occurrence wins, since both
    carry the same server-stamped received_at), while copies that straddle a
    block boundary land in separate parts and wait for a background merge
    like any other duplicate. Callers that can see Kafka redeliveries within
    one poll should dedup by event_id before building the batch rather than
    rely on this.

    An anomaly is defined as an abnormal rate of denied requests for a user in a 1-hour window with more than

    - High: deny rate >= 0.5
    - Medium: 0.3 <= deny rate < 0.5

    Time complexity and space complexity are both O(n), with n the number of requests in the given time window.
    For large datasets, chunks of data can be processed in batches to avoid memory issues.
    An other approach is to pre-compute the anomalies in ClickHouse with a periodical job, and only compute the new anomalies in the API call.

    These optimizations should be implemented once the data volume grows and performance issues arise.
